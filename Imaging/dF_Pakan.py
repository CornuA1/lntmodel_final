Calculate dF/F(0) as done in Pakan et.al. 2016

"
502 Pixel intensity within each ROI 502 was averaged to create a raw fluorescence
503 time series F(t). Baseline fluorescence F0 was computed for each neuron by taking the 5th
504 percentile of the smoothed F(t) (1Hz lowpass, zero-phase, 60th-order FIR filter) over each
505 trial (F0(t)), averaged across all trials. As a consequence, the same baseline F0 was used for
506 computing the changes in fluorescence in darkness and during visual stimulation. The
507 change in fluorescence relative to baseline, Î”F/F0 was computed by taking the difference
508 between F and F0(t) and dividing by F0.
